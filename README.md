### `The inspiration`

My girlfriend always told me ..."David if you really want to improve your English you'd better learn the song lyrics, <br />
that is one of the best things for mastering the spoken English"<br />

That's great but every time I tried it I always stopped my self after memorizing the first couple of verses<br />
I thought, why not to build a web-application where I can finally receive via e-mail one verse per day or<br />
maybe every two days or more?

### `Goals`

Said that, I decided to build first the front-end side to mastering my React skills HTML/CSS<br />
and then I would like to add a backend later<br />
The idea is to query an API to retrieve the song lyrics and then give the possibility to the user to chunk the song<br />
Then set it to receive one verse everyday in his email address.
